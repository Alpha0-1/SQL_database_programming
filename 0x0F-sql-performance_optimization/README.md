## Usage Notes

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you are running these examples in a PostgreSQL environment. Adapt table and column names to your schema.
2. **Error Handling**: Always include proper error handling in production code. These examples focus on performance optimization.
3. **Permissions**: Some operations (e.g., creating indexes, modifying settings) may require administrative privileges.
4. **Consult Documentation**: Always consult the PostgreSQL documentation for specific configuration settings and best practices.
